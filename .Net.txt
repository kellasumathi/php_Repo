C# & .NET
The difference between C# and .Net is
C# is a Programming language
.net is a framework, where we can build applications.

C#: we have CLR
the work of clr is to convert the code into an intermediate language(IL) and later on, it will convert it into a
 Native language(computer language)

* CLR is essentially an application that is sitting in the memory whose job is to translate the IL code into the
 machine code and this process are called just-in-time compilation or JIT.

When we are building an application using C#
- The application consists of building blocks called classes, these         |   class class class class  |
classes collaborate with each other at runtime and as a result the 
the application provides some functionality.

Class:
 A class is a container that has the data and methods { In data we have attributes and functions which are 
also called methods}  functions or methods that have behavior that does things for us, and data represent 
the state of the application.  for ex:  think of a 
                                                       car  - class

                                                      make 
                                                      model     } -   Attributes
                                                      color   

                                                      Start()
                                                      Move()    } - methods

Variable: A name was given to the storage location in the memory.
constant: An immutable value.
Naming conventions:
Camel Case: firstName
pasalCase: FirstName
Hungarian Notation: strFirstName

* In c# the keyword var makes the variable declaration easier,
 instead of explicitly specifying the datatype, we can simply 
write the var.
